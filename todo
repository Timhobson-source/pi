- bug: chart scale/size is weird when simulations occur but fine when stopped
- feature: chart size auto fit to screen
- feature: add pi horizontal line to chart for context
- feature: have chart "zoom in" on latest values
- tech debt: add tests? (at least learn to be able to property test) - with Junit?
